**Pymaceuticals Observations**

After 45 days of treatment, the mice treated with Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo did not have a positive response to treatment. Their tumors continued to grow in volume.

Most drugs do not appear to have no better outcome than the placebo. Other than Capomulin, we notice that the mice treated with the other drugs and placebo die at a very similar rate

Capomulin outperformed Infubinol and Ketapril in terms of tumor reductions after treatment and survival rate
