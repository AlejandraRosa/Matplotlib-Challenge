**Pymaceuticals Observations**

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time.

1. The tumors of the mice treated with Infubinol, Ketapril and Placebo did not have a positive response to treatment. Their tumors continued to grow in volume over the course of the 45 days.

While analyzing mice survival rate by days, we notice Infubinol and Ketrapil do not appear to have no better outcome than the placebo. Other than Capomulin, we notice that the mice treated with drugs die at a very similar rate than mice treated with placebo.

Capomulin outperformed Infubinol and Ketapril in terms of tumor reductions after treatment and survival rate
